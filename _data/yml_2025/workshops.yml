  description: "APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) serve as powerful tools for accessing and interacting with data in a structured and automated manner, providing capabilities far beyond what is possible through traditional interfaces. Despite their ubiquity in software development, APIs remain underutilized in humanities research, where they offer immense potential for innovative data collection and analysis.

In this session, we’ll demystify APIs and showcase their potential through the Library of Congress API. Participants will see step-by-step how to identify if a collection has API access, construct requests, and interpret responses, all with tools like Postman. We’ll walk through concepts like authentication, endpoints, parameters, and how to transform JSON responses into tabular data for visualization.

This session is designed as a show-and-tell introduction—perfect for researchers and students with no prior coding or data analysis experience. By the end, attendees will have a clear understanding of how APIs work, their practical applications, and how to start integrating them into their research workflows. Get ready to see what APIs can do for your projects!"

This session will feature QualiAnon, an open-source tool designed to help researchers securely anonymize and pseudonymize sensitive qualitative data with precision and flexibility. Unlike automated tools that rely on blind substitutions, QualiAnon gives you full control over how and when data is anonymized, allowing you to manually define replacement rules for specific datasets or variables. This approach ensures a higher level of accuracy and privacy by stripping identifying information without compromising the richness of the data. In this session, we’ll demonstrate how QualiAnon can streamline your data protection efforts, improve your workflow, and ensure compliance with privacy standards. Don’t miss the chance to discover how this tool can simplify the de-identification process while safeguarding sensitive information in your research!"

</p>
<p>
Description: This project collects and presents MASD, an open-source Multimodal Activity Sensing Dataset designed to advance machine learning research in human activity recognition (HAR). MASD integrates data collected from three daily sensing devices: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data in smartwatches and smartphones, WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) extracted by routers and body skeleton data captured by a Kinect camera. MASD enables various HAR research directions, including WiFi-based HAR, multimodal integration, sensing domain adaptation, and foundation model development. We highlight its potential by introducing a recently accepted paper that learns skeleton representation for downstream HAR tasks.

As described by the UC Berkeley Oral History Center, this approach involves producing "first-person narrative topical and life histories that explore the narrator’s understanding of events through a recorded interview...[this] results in a lightly edited transcript of the interview that the narrator reviews, which is then published." This differs from the more familiar qualitative research interview, in that it is a two-directional, and transparent process... which comes with its own challenges. In this workshop you will learn more about these synergies and contrasts between and within methods, hear more about best practices for conducting oral history projects, and have time to ask questions about project ideas of your own.'

In this workshop, we will go beyond what AI tools do (or their creators say they do) and take a hard look at the broader implications of developing and using artificial intelligence. We will explore the power structures that inform the human labor behind AI, as well as the impacts of AI development and use on natural ecosystems, systematic oppression, and information economies. We will also discuss the agency we retain as students, teachers, and lifelong learners to co-create critical frameworks that challenge the inevitability of robot overlords.

  description: "Sharing and reusing data can effectively reduce redundant efforts in data collection. It also enhances the efficiency of scientific research investments by preventing the reinvention of the wheel. Building a sustainable data-reuse process and culture requires frameworks that include policies, standards, roles, and responsibilities, all of which must address the diverse needs of data providers, curators, and (re)users alike.

A critical step in the data sharing and (re)use cycle involves researchers depositing their research data into data-sharing infrastructures, keeping their data in a sharable and usable form, making other researchers aware of their data, and identifying data that are (re)usable for their needs.

In this session, I aim to introduce some ideas and techniques for preparing research data for sharing. I will also introduce 2 to 3 data repositories ideal for researchers depositing their data and seeking (re)usable data for their studies. Additionally, I will offer several tips and strategies for identifying and utilizing (re)usable data effectively.

The session is structured to last approximately 50 minutes, comprising a 40-minute presentation followed by a 10-minute question-and-answer segment."

  description: UCLA library holds one of the largest collections of Islamic manuscripts (roughly 10,000 items) covering multiple languages including Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Urdu, and spanning nearly 9 centuries (12th-20th). Currently, UCLA Library Special Collections is in the process of a multi-year effort to create digital records for its Islamic Manuscript holdings. At HumTech, our team is engaged in a project to visualize the cataloged manuscripts through Tableau. The goal of this project is to represent a birds eye view of the Islamic manuscript holdings for interested researchers. Through representation of multiple data points that the library cataloging process captured from the manuscripts, the visualization hopes to provide easy access to researchers for dissecting the data in multiple ways and helping them in drawing useful insights into the Islamic manuscript holdings at UCLA. In this presentation, we will be discussing the challenges that we faced in data cleaning, wrangling and visualization that are specific to manuscript collections, especially one that is primarily in non-Latin script and spans to the pre-modern period.

  description: "We'll discuss how people approach finding spatial data to identify which methods work for certain kinds of data. Participants should be prepared to discuss their own process and to ask questions. This will be more of a discussion than an instructor-lead workshop. We'll work as a group to document and share what we discover together."
