      <description>Have you wanted to use APIs to gather data, but aren’t quite sure where to start?  This is the workshop for you.  During this 60 minute workshop, we will cover the basic functionality and terminology of APIs while walking through three examples.  We will also describe and share resources available to help you use them.  We will demonstrate that APIs are not as big, scary, and inaccessible as they might originally seem.</description>

      <description>A map in a GIS (geographic information system) may dazzle us with its visual appeal and complexity, but if the data it contains is out-of-date, offset, incomplete, or too generalized, how useful is it? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this workshop you will learn what to look out for while discovering and managing GIS data. Topics include key parameters of geospatial data, acquiring data, file formats, and including tabular data in a GIS.</description>

      <description>A weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. As this project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, an emphasis was placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem. However, any code-based methodology is welcome - just please remember to share the code used to generate the results.</description>

      <description>Do you need data for the gagillion papers you have to write this quarter? Or maybe you're going up for tenure and need to publish? How about teaching students to use data (but you don't have time to create that lesson plan, we're in a pandemic after all!) Don't worry, ICPSR has you covered. Join us for this presentation to learn about the classroom resources, data training, and over 15,000 datasets that are available to you for free. With data on economics, political science, public health and so much more, there is something data here for you.</description>

      <description>Personal projects are a common way for data science students to gain experience and build up a project portfolio. Unlike projects for a course or capstone sequence, personal projects are entirely self-directed by students and can be on any topic - and topics can get quite creative! Join us for an hour of lightning talks from UC students as they share their data science focused personal projects, focusing on data access, data cleaning, and any data privacy concerns.</description>

      <description>This 2-part workshop explores basic, practical applied statistics using the R statistical programming language. On the first day we’ll focus on common procedures like assessing the distribution of your data and calculating differences between groups. In the second day we’ll focus on common linear models (linear regression, ANOVA, etc.) in R. We will also calculate the power of a simple study. This workshop is appropriate for learners with various data types, but will most emphasize continuous numerical data. Prior experience with R and RStudio required.</description>

      <description>In late 2020 the NIH announced their new Policy for Data Management and Sharing. Starting in 2023, this policy will require all NIH researchers to prospectively plan for how their scientific data will be preserved and shared through submission of a Data Management and Sharing Plan. While they might not be required by the NIH for two years, we encourage researchers to start writing data management plans now as they are a useful tool for planning and tracking research data.This session will give an overview of data management plans (DMPs), dive deep into the new NIH requirements, and share local resources and tools like DMPTool.</description>

      <description>twarc is a command line tool and Python library for gathering and working with Twitter JSON data via the public Twitter API. Emerging from the Black Lives Matter and Document the Now movements, twarc comes along with a loose set of community standards that respect the autonomy of the user and aligns with the EU's GDPR and Twitter's terms of service.  As part of supporting social media research, the UCSB Library Collaboratory will get you started with what you need to use twarc and present current ethical best practices that we use to orient researchers to social media research.</description>

      <description>This workshop covers an introduction to natural language processing (NLP) and caveats for its application to health data. Using the R programming language we will introduce the basics of text processing and demo how to calculate common metrics including word frequencies, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF), and principal component analysis (PCA) to explore important words and group similar documents. We will also introduce more advanced NLP topics (sentiment analysis, topic modeling, etc.) and discuss classical versus deep learning approaches, as time permits. Learners with proficient R skills are encouraged to code along.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wanted to harvest data off a website that was not already in an analysis-friendly format? If so, this web scraping workshop is for you! Web scraping can be done entirely manually but it is usually faster, more efficient and less error-prone if automated. UCSB Research Data Services will navigate you through some basic web scraping techniques including how to use XPath and the Chrome web browser with the Scraper extension to extract data from the web with little technical knowlege.  We will also discuss the ethical issues of web scraping.</description>

      <description>This workshop will unpack the subjective process of data visualization and its relationship to concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion. We'll critically explore how data can be used to uphold and perpetuate, or quantify and demonstrate structural oppression. Through this workshop learners will practice the technique of "data visceralization," the process of experiencing differences in data and understanding them viscerally. This workshop is led by UC Davis DataLab's Data Feminism research and learning cluster, which focuses on thinking about data science and data ethics as informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism.

      <description>This 5-part workshop series aims to help learners understand the relatively small but fundamental computational model underlying the R language. This will help you reason about code before you write and run it, and to debug it if it doesn’t do what you want. A sound understanding of this computational model makes programming in R much easier and more productive! This workshop series is intended for active engagement – be prepared to come to each session with questions about why some things worked, and others didn’t. All researchers (students, postdocs, faculty and staff) who meet the ‘prerequisites’ are welcome to register for this workshop series, which is being offered in person at the UC Davis DataLab, and will be broadcast as part of UC Love Data Week. An optional final 5th session will be offered entirely remotely for additional Q&amp;A by all audiences. Learners who can attend all sessions will receive priority registration for the limited in person seats. Broadcast participants still need to register to receive the Zoom link.</description>

      <description>This three-part workshop series covers the basics of text mining with Python. We will focus primarily on unstructured text data, discussing how to format and clean text to enable the discovery of significant patterns in collections of documents. Sessions will introduce participants to core terminology in text mining/natural language processing and will walk through different methods of ranking terms and documents. We will conclude by using these methods to classify texts and to build models of 'topics.' Basic familiarity with Python is required. We welcome students, postdocs, faculty, and staff from a variety of research domains, ranging from health informatics to the humanities. This workshop occurs during UC Love Data Week, and all members of the University of California system are welcome to register.</description>

      <description>High resolution 3D sensor data (including lidar sonar and photogrammetric models) are becoming commonplace. We can walk out into the world with an iphone and capture multi billion point sub milimeter detail models of huge structures. Almost every academic discipline now incorporates some form of 3D data. In this presentation we will demonstrate new methods which allow us to access and utilize these unwieldy datasets, leveraging network storage for visualization, metrology, and annotation.</description>

      <description>In this workshop, attendees will learn to clean spreadsheet data and anonymize interview data in preparation for analysis in Taguette, a free qualitative analysis software. Through hands-on work with sample texts, participants will learn to import, code, and export qualitative data, and gain an understanding of how coding fits into the broader qualitative research lifecycle. Attendees will also learn to move from the mechanics of coding to thinking more conceptually about their data. Finally, we will talk about how to share qualitative data for future use or reuse. This workshop is designed for those with beginner-intermediate experience with qualitative research, but all are welcome.</description>

      <description>An increasing number of funders and publishers have implemented data sharing policies to amplify transparency and reproducibility in published research. In addition the National Institutes of Health has recently issued a new final policy for data management and sharing, expanding the requirements for data management and sharing. In anticipation of these changes the UCLA Library developed UCLA Dataverse, a locally administered data repository that fulfills requirements for publishing deidentified data associated with research publications. This session will cover the stages at which data should be published, some background information on UCLA Dataverse, and use cases to demonstrate its functionality.</description>

      <description>This event is organized as a semi-structured open lab.  We'll use the weekly social data project #TidyTuesday as a jumping-off point for working and communicating with data. Tidy Tuesday is a weekly data project for the R ecosystem. As this project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, an emphasis was placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with the tidyverse ecosystem. However, any code-based methodology is welcome - just please remember to share the code used to generate the results.</description>

      <description>Do you want to learn to do text analysis?  Or learn to teach it?  The new text analysis platform from ITHAKA, the same folks who brought you JSTOR and Portico, is a platform for teaching, learning, and performing text analysis.  In this session, we’ll demonstrate how you can build datasets that interest you from JSTOR or Portico content, receive some instant visualizations of data in your dataset, and run through some of the Constellate tutorials to learn to do some analysis.</description>

      <description>Researchers across the UC system are engaged in a vast array of areas that intersect with issues of ethics and justice. However, due to unique circumstances for each respective discipline, these topics are often glanced over in traditional course curricula, and often absent from research discussion forums in academic settings. In this session, data librarians from UCLA and UC Berkeley will host an interdisciplinary discussion on data ethics and justice in research. Graduate researchers in STEM and humanities disciplines will present how their research intersects with ethical issues in data privacy and security. Following these presentations will be breakout discussions focused on the areas presented by the speakers. This session will foster conversation around addressing and taking action on issues of data ethics and justice in the UC-wide research community. This event is open to all UC researchers, staff and students and does not require background knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Featured speakers:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nashra Mahmood is a 5th year in the Gender Studies Ph.D. program at the University of California, Los Angeles. They hold a BA in Economics and Gender Studies from Knox College and a MA in Gender Studies from the University of California, Los Angeles. Their undergraduate research focused on feminized labor and unionization in North India’s informal economy. Currently, they are studying how media manipulation and communalist and racist [dis]information in Indian media post-October 2019 has reconstituted national belonging in India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mary Anne Smart is a computer science Ph.D. student at UC San Diego studying human-computer interaction. In her work, she investigates ways to improve privacy communication with non-expert users of technology and explores how people think about data privacy issues. During Winter 2022, she is working as a visiting researcher at Columbia University.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jacob Swoveland received his Bachelor of Statistics at the University of California, Riverside in 2019. Following his graduation, he spent 2 years working in Medical Billing and Information Security at Epic Health Systems in Verona, Wisconsin. He is currently working on a M.S. of Statistics at the University of California, Los Angeles.</description>

      <description>Wikipedia’s inclusion trouble is well-documented. While the reasons are up for debate, the practical effect of this disparity is not: content is skewed by the lack of participation by underrepresented groups. This adds up to an alarming absence in an important repository of shared knowledge. Let’s change that! Join us on Zoom for a tutorial for the beginner Wikipedian followed by communal updating of Wikipedia entries.</description>

      <description>This interactive, dialogue-driven meetup will explore applying feminist theory and critique to how we work with data and perform research. How do structures of power and oppression shape the data we collect, analyses we perform, and research insights we develop? Together we will reflect on selected chapters from the (freely available) book Data Feminism by Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein. Come prepared to apply takeaways from the readings to unpacking provided case studies from the health sciences, and your own research processes. Researchers from all domains are welcome to participate. Together we’ll brainstorm how as individuals and a community we can contribute to more equitable data-driven research.</description>

      <description>In this intermediate workshop, we will provide a hands-on example of working with an API using Python in Jupyter Notebooks.  We will query an API based on search terms, examine and interpret JSON results, display results as a dataframe, and build functions to facilitate API call replicability.  If you are a beginner to APIs, and want to powerlevel your knowledge, the recording and slides to last year's UC Love Data Week's introductory API workshop are available, which covers how APIs work and API documentation.  Prerequisites for the workshop are - Basic understanding of how APIs work - Installation of Jupyter Notebooks with Python - Installation of the following packages - Beginner knowledge of Python (e.g. assign, for loops, functions, importing libraries)</description>

      <description>Virtual Reality (VR) has evolved from an expensive and finicky niche technology only available at well-funded large institutions, into a practical consumer product with tremendous research potential. While current-generation VR devices are primarily intended for the video gaming market, their use is not limited to gaming and has tremendous potential for researchers. The VR Research Initiative at UC Davis DataLab is translating visualization technology initially created for the UC Davis W.M. Keck Center for Active Visualization in the Earth Sciences (KeckCAVES), to function with modern commodity VR devices. By developing and supporting open-source software for gaming VR headsets, DataLab seeks to promote equitable access to emerging technologies and enable diverse communities of researchers and the public to explore 3D data. In this session, we will discuss the fundamental principles and reasons why VR is highly effective for the analysis of large and complex three-dimensional data. We will introduce several concrete VR applications based on those principles that are being developed at UC Davis DataLab, and will describe how participants can build their own VR systems, able to run DataLabs VR applications, at their own institutions. By the end of this session participants will be able to: describe how current-generation virtual reality (VR) technology such as VR headsets meant for gaming can effectively be used for scientific data analysis; discuss why VR is useful for analysis of data, specifically complex and large three-dimensional data; and identify where to go to learn more about setting up their own VR systems using the latest VR technologies for research.</description>

      <description>Put on your digital historian hat and join us for an exploration of web archiving as data! In this session we will answer questions such as: What even is web archiving? Why should I care about it? How do I access web archived stuff? What kind of analysis can I do with it? We will use as a case study UC San Diego's guidance for covid prevention, as posted on websites, from Spring 2020 - present. We'll demonstrate how to retrieve the history of a website, work with the html text data in Python, and track changes regarding campus guidance on topics like masking and remote instruction.</description>

      <description>Rigor and reproducibility are at the core of modern science. Many new initiatives and tools have been established to address barriers to reproducibility. While very welcome, these projects have led to a proliferation of online tools and resources which can be hard to sift through. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Reproducibility for Everyone (R4E) is a global, community-led reproducibility education initiative. R4E runs practical and accessible workshops to introduce the concept of reproducibility to researchers. We demonstrate reproducible tools and methods that can improve research by making it more efficient, transparent, and rigorous. Every R4E workshop is customized for the audience. Since 2018, R4E volunteer instructors have reached over 2500 researchers around the world through over 40 workshops.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; This workshop will introduce reproducible workflows and a range of tools along the themes of organization, documentation, analysis, and dissemination. After a brief introduction to the topic of reproducibility, the workshop will provide specific tips and tools useful in improving daily research workflows. The content will include modules such as data management, electronic lab notebooks, reproducible bioinformatics tools and methods, protocol and reagent sharing, data visualization, and version control. All modules include interactive learning, real-time participation, and active knowledge sharing. The methods and tools introduced help researchers share work with their future self, their immediate colleagues, and the wider scientific community. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Following this workshop, participants will be able to: &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; Apply a conceptual framework for reproducibility, replicability, and robustness of research.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Explore practical, accessible tools and methods for advancing the reproducibility of research.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Reuse and adapt the Reproducibility for Everyone modular curriculum to their own training and research needs.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Evaluate their reproducibility barriers and solutions through interactive knowledge sharing.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>Wikipedia’s inclusion trouble is well-documented. While the reasons are up for debate, the practical effect of this disparity is not: content is skewed by the lack of participation by underrepresented groups. This adds up to an alarming absence in an important repository of shared knowledge. Let’s change that! Join us on Zoom for a tutorial for the beginner Wikipedian followed by communal updating of Wikipedia entries.</description>

      <description>Technical advancements through data science combined with the exponential increase in data has led to research breakthroughs across domains and generated entirely new industries. But, lagging behind this growth is our understanding of the evolving socio-technical landscape and ability to predict the indirect consequences of our work. While laws determine the legal parameters governing data use, data science approaches that are technically legal can still be used unethically and irresponsibly, with disastrous consequences from loss of revenue to human rights violations. Through case studies and interactive sessions, this workshop provides an overview of how to practice responsible data science by incorporating considerations of ethics, equity, and justice. We will discuss FACT (fairness, accuracy, confidentiality, and transparency) based approaches to increasing the integrity of our work in data science. By the end of this workshop, learner should be able to: Describe examples of how the development of data science can both contribute to inequities and be leveraged to address them in their own domain. Begin to identify the underlying goals and incentives influencing their data-driven research. Assess whether a research project’s data meets FAIR criteria. Use a responsible data science framework to evaluate the potential impact(s) of a research project case study. Revise their research design using FACT principles.</description>

      <description>Whether you are a student, researcher, or library worker, library collections are a rich potential source of data for research or community projects. The concept of "collections as data" relates to the responsible use and reuse of cultural heritage materials, university archives, and other digitized records for data-driven research in both the sciences and humanities. UC libraries are increasingly joining other cultural heritage stewards in providing researchers with datasets drawn from their collections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This workshop will introduce participants to both technical resources and ethical considerations for the reuse of library collections as research data. We will discuss the importance of metadata and documentation when using collections as data, and will look at one tool for computationally analyzing collections (HathiTrust Research Center Analytics). We will also explore some specific collections held by UCR Library and UCSF Library Archives &amp; Special Collections that are available to use as data for historical research.</description>

      <description>Join us for a Wikidata edit-a-thon!  This is a great opportunity to learn basic Wikidata editing skills, and how Wikidata can be relevant to your research.  From 10 - 11am, we'll cover how to add and edit Wikidata items.  From 11am until 1pm, you can choose your level of participation.  Dive into some hands-on solo editing or ask questions.  While you can bring your own data projects, we will have a project list, so everything you need to successfully edit or upload a Wikidata item will be provided during the session.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No previous knowledge of Wikidata is necessary, but we highly recommend attending the Wikidata Basics workshop held on Monday, February 13, 2023.</description>

      <description>This workshop is an introduction to the Julia programming language for people familiar with R, Python, or MATLAB. Compared to those languages, Julia code typically runs orders of magnitude faster but has a similar level of abstraction, so you can focus on your research problem rather than hardware minutiae. Julia also provides out-of-the-box Unicode support, an easy-to-use package manager, multithreading facilities, a macro system, and a rich type system to optimize and prevent bugs in your code. Workshop topics include a concise overview of Julia's syntax and features, an end-to-end introduction to using built-in functions and contributed packages to read, summarize, and visualize tabular data, and real-world examples where we've found Julia beneficial.

      <description>In this hands-on hybrid workshop, learners will explore the relationships within data clouds and images to build and render 3D images. What does that really mean? That we’ll take lots of photos of an object to create 3d image data. We will step through capturing images using openly available software with a smart phone or tablet.  We will also discuss what contributes to successful 3D scanning, and touch on different techniques currently used.  Choose your favorite object (about 1 foot or 12 inches in height) to practice with during this hands-on workshop.</description>

      <description>Python and Stata and R, oh my! Is the prospect of having to learn to code getting you down? Do you ever feel like you'd like to just get into the data directly but aren't sure how? In this workshop we'll explore the many ways you can perform data analysis without needing to know statistical packages or languages first. We'll look at tools which let you upload your own data, tools for data visualization, and administrative data sites and tools which allow for interactive data requests and table creation, among other possibilities. No prior data analysis experience necessary.</description>

      <description>Wikipedia is among the most visited websites in the world; it is routinely cited in scholarly articles, the news, and congressional hearings. But Wikipedia openly admits its content is skewed by the gender and racial imbalance of its editors. You can be part of the solution! Join us on Zoom for a tutorial for the beginner Wikipedian, then edit some Wikipedia entries yourself (you may want to sign up for a free Wikipedia account in advance). You may bring topic ideas or articles you’d like to edit, or we’ll help you find a way to make a difference in an area of interest to you!</description>

      <description>First Session: Sharing and reusing data can effectively reduce redundant efforts in data collection, ultimately saving valuable time and resources, especially for smaller laboratories. Additionally, it enhances the efficiency of scientific research investments by preventing the reinvention of the wheel. Building a sustainable data-reuse process and culture relies on frameworks that comprise policies, standards, roles, and responsibilities, all of which must address the diverse needs of data providers, curators, and (re)users alike. A critical step in the data sharing and (re)use cycle involves researchers identifying data that are (re)usable for their needs. It is a common challenge among researchers to locate data that appear (re)usable. In this session, I aim to introduce 2-3 data repositories ideal for researchers seeking (re)usable data for their studies. Additionally, I will offer several tips and strategies for identifying and utilizing (re)usable data effectively. The session is structured to last approximately 45 minutes, encompassing a 25-minute presentation, a 5-minute question-and-answer segment, and a 10-minute practical workshop exercise. Second Session: Social media is increasingly becoming an important site for data collection and research for students, researchers, and scholars across the Humanities and Social Sciences. This workshop introduces participants to the existing landscape of social media data and the fluctuating access academics have to ‘big datasets’. Using Facebook, Twitter (or X), and Reddit as examples of data archives, we discuss the latest guidelines and restrictions on scraping social media data from these three platforms and how they affect researchers conducting social media research. The workshop urges participants to rethink their notion of “Data” concerning social media to foreground the issue of research ethics that is often sidestepped or not taken seriously due to the presumed publicness of social media data.</description>

      <description>Wikipedia is among the most visited websites in the world, but even Wikipedia&amp;#39;s staff acknowledge that its content reflects its editorship (75.6 percent of US editors are white and 90 percent are male). These editors decide which topics are &amp;#39;notable&amp;#39; and therefore worthy of inclusion, which often excludes genderqueer and female individuals and topics from the global South. Read more in our blog post, &lt;a href="https://update.lib.berkeley.edu/2025/01/09/the-bias-of-notability-in-wikipedia/" target="_blank"&gt;The Bias of Notability in Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.You can be part of the solution! Join us on February 10 on Zoom for a tutorial for the beginner Wikipedian, then edit some Wikipedia entries yourself. &lt;a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:CreateAccount&amp;returnto=Main+Page" target="_blank"&gt;Sign up for a free Wikipedia account&lt;/a&gt; in advance (optional). You may bring topic ideas or articles you&amp;#39;d like to edit, or we&amp;#39;ll help you find a way to make a difference in an area of interest to you.</description>

      <description>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) serve as powerful tools for accessing and interacting with data in a structured and automated manner, providing capabilities far beyond what is possible through traditional interfaces. Despite their ubiquity in software development, APIs remain underutilized in humanities research, where they offer immense potential for innovative data collection and analysis.
In this session, we’ll demystify APIs and showcase their potential through the Library of Congress API. Participants will see step-by-step how to identify if a collection has API access, construct requests, and interpret responses, all with tools like Postman. We’ll walk through concepts like authentication, endpoints, parameters, and how to transform JSON responses into tabular data for visualization.
This session is designed as a show-and-tell introduction—perfect for researchers and students with no prior coding or data analysis experience. By the end, attendees will have a clear understanding of how APIs work, their practical applications, and how to start integrating them into their research workflows. Get ready to see what APIs can do for your projects!</description>

      <description>Join us for practical tips on qualitative data de-identification and strategies to tackle the unique challenges researchers face when working with human subject data. This session will feature QualiAnon, an open-source tool designed to help researchers securely anonymize and pseudonymize sensitive qualitative data with precision and flexibility. Unlike automated tools that rely on blind substitutions, QualiAnon gives you full control over how and when data is anonymized, allowing you to manually define replacement rules for specific datasets or variables. This approach ensures a higher level of accuracy and privacy by stripping identifying information without compromising the richness of the data. In this session, we’ll demonstrate how QualiAnon can streamline your data protection efforts, improve your workflow, and ensure compliance with privacy standards. Don’t miss the chance to discover how this tool can simplify the de-identification process while safeguarding sensitive information in your research!</description>

&lt;p&gt; Title: The Collection and Application of MASD, a Multimodal Activity Sensing Dataset &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Description: This project collects and presents MASD, an open-source Multimodal Activity Sensing Dataset designed to advance machine learning research in human activity recognition (HAR). MASD integrates data collected from three daily sensing devices: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data in smartwatches and smartphones, WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) extracted by routers and body skeleton data captured by a Kinect camera. MASD enables various HAR research directions, including WiFi-based HAR, multimodal integration, sensing domain adaptation, and foundation model development. We highlight its potential by introducing a recently accepted paper that learns skeleton representation for downstream HAR tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Speaker: Alessandro D'Amico &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Title: Towards Large-Scale EEG Data Collection &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Description: Novel insights into human cognition can benefit from advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, these modern models are dependent on large volumes of high quality datasets. This talk describes some groundwork conducted on validating low-cost EEG amplifiers for studying human cognition, as well as pilot studies into data collection in non-lab environments in order to explore the feasibility of large-scale EEG data acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Quarto is a publication tool built into the RStudio multilanguage data analysis and visualization platform, often used in conjunction with code notebooks. Quarto enables a more reproducible approach to data-driven research by integrating documentation, code, and results in one document. But it’s also a great publication platform on its own! In this session a panel of Quarto users will showcase what Quarto is capable of, especially when used in concert with GitHub Pages hosting, including creating websites (course websites, personal websites, blogs), presentations, dashboards, academic papers, and books. We will also demonstrate, in real-time, how easy it is to create such research deliverables. Prepare to be sold on using Quarto!</description>

      <description>Qualitative research encompasses many methodological approaches, and one of the most powerful is oral history. As described by the UC Berkeley Oral History Center, this approach involves producing "first-person narrative topical and life histories that explore the narrator’s understanding of events through a recorded interview...[this] results in a lightly edited transcript of the interview that the narrator reviews, which is then published." This differs from the more familiar qualitative research interview, in that it is a two-directional, and transparent process... which comes with its own challenges. In this workshop you will learn more about these synergies and contrasts between and within methods, hear more about best practices for conducting oral history projects, and have time to ask questions about project ideas of your own.</description>

      <description>This is the third in a 3-part Modern Practical Scholar workshop series designed to share inclusive, equitable, and sustainable practices for knowledge acquisition. We'll focus on setting up and using free, open source software to swiftly gather, organize, and curate research literature. These workshops are applicable for any level of scholarship, and may be attended as a series or separately. This specific workshop is being offered in person on the UC Davis campus with a Zoom broadcast for remote participants. &lt;p&gt;After this workshop on bibliometrics in R, learners will be able to apply a bibliometric analysis framework to quickly gather the most relevant documents in a domain of science, and specifically&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Describe the base principles and purpose of using bibliometric analysis&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Recognize and apply R packages and functions to perform bibliometric analysis&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Analyze bibliometric data to identify patterns and relationships in a corpus&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Create and rapidly review a subset of most important documents from a corpus&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prerequisites.&lt;/b&gt; All members of the UC Davis and UC Love Data Week community are welcome to attend. If you'd like to code along, bring your laptop with internet access and the latest version of R installed. Note that this workshop is not an introduction to R and learners are expected to have already acquired basic fluency in the language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>No matter whether you love it, fear it, or are sick of hearing about it, artificial intelligence impacts our lives. In this workshop, we will go beyond what AI tools do (or their creators say they do) and take a hard look at the broader implications of developing and using artificial intelligence. We will explore the power structures that inform the human labor behind AI, as well as the impacts of AI development and use on natural ecosystems, systematic oppression, and information economies. We will also discuss the agency we retain as students, teachers, and lifelong learners to co-create critical frameworks that challenge the inevitability of robot overlords.</description>

      <description>Sharing and reusing data can effectively reduce redundant efforts in data collection. It also enhances the efficiency of scientific research investments by preventing the reinvention of the wheel. Building a sustainable data-reuse process and culture requires frameworks that include policies, standards, roles, and responsibilities, all of which must address the diverse needs of data providers, curators, and (re)users alike.
A critical step in the data sharing and (re)use cycle involves researchers depositing their research data into data-sharing infrastructures, keeping their data in a sharable and usable form, making other researchers aware of their data, and identifying data that are (re)usable for their needs.
In this session, I aim to introduce some ideas and techniques for preparing research data for sharing. I will also introduce 2 to 3 data repositories ideal for researchers depositing their data and seeking (re)usable data for their studies. Additionally, I will offer several tips and strategies for identifying and utilizing (re)usable data effectively.
The session is structured to last approximately 50 minutes, comprising a 40-minute presentation followed by a 10-minute question-and-answer segment.</description>

      <description>UCLA library holds one of the largest collections of Islamic manuscripts (roughly 10,000 items) covering multiple languages including Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Urdu, and spanning nearly 9 centuries (12th-20th). Currently, UCLA Library Special Collections is in the process of a multi-year effort to create digital records for its Islamic Manuscript holdings. At HumTech, our team is engaged in a project to visualize the cataloged manuscripts through Tableau. The goal of this project is to represent a birds eye view of the Islamic manuscript holdings for interested researchers. Through representation of multiple data points that the library cataloging process captured from the manuscripts, the visualization hopes to provide easy access to researchers for dissecting the data in multiple ways and helping them in drawing useful insights into the Islamic manuscript holdings at UCLA. In this presentation, we will be discussing the challenges that we faced in data cleaning, wrangling and visualization that are specific to manuscript collections, especially one that is primarily in non-Latin script and spans to the pre-modern period.</description>

      <description>The Industry Documents Library is a digital archive of documents created by industries which influence public health, hosted by the University of California, San Francisco Library. This archive contains millions of video, audio, and image files from the tobacco, opioids, fossil fuel, drug, and food industries, including advertisements, legal depositions, internal marketing documents, public health campaigns, and other historical records. This session will start with a presentation and overview of the contents of the IDL and search interface. Next, we will introduce a python based, open-source stack researchers can use to analyze, transcribe, and categorize data in IDL video, audio, and image files. Although participants will have an opportunity to try out these technologies during the workshop, the primary focus will be an overview of available tools and data, and participation in the programming sections is optional.</description>
