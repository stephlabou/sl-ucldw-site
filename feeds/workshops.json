A sound understanding of this computational model makes programming in R much easier and more productive! This workshop series is intended for active engagement – be prepared to come to each session with questions about why some things worked, and others didn't. All researchers (students, postdocs, faculty and staff) who meet the ‘prerequisites' are welcome to register for this workshop series, which is being offered in person at the UC Davis DataLab, and will be broadcast as part of UC Love Data Week. An optional final 5th session will be offered entirely remotely for additional Q&A by all audiences.

Come prepared to apply takeaways from the readings to unpacking provided case studies from the health sciences, and your own research processes. Researchers from all domains are welcome to participate. Together we'll brainstorm how as individuals and a community we can contribute to more equitable data-driven research.",

        "description": "Virtual Reality (VR) has evolved from an expensive and finicky niche technology only available at well-funded large institutions, into a practical consumer product with tremendous research potential. While current-generation VR devices are primarily intended for the video gaming market, their use is not limited to gaming and has tremendous potential for researchers. The VR Research Initiative at UC Davis DataLab is translating visualization technology initially created for the UC Davis W.M. Keck Center for Active Visualization in the Earth Sciences (KeckCAVES), to function with modern commodity VR devices. By developing and supporting open-source software for gaming VR headsets, DataLab seeks to promote equitable access to emerging technologies and enable diverse communities of researchers and the public to explore 3D data. In this session, we will discuss the fundamental principles and reasons why VR is highly effective for the analysis of large and complex three-dimensional data. We will introduce several concrete VR applications based on those principles that are being developed at UC Davis DataLab, and will describe how participants can build their own VR systems, able to run DataLabs VR applications, at their own institutions. By the end of this session participants will be able to: describe how current-generation virtual reality (VR) technology such as VR headsets meant for gaming can effectively be used for scientific data analysis; discuss why VR is useful for analysis of data, specifically complex and large three-dimensional data; and identify where to go to learn more about setting up their own VR systems using the latest VR technologies for research.",

While laws determine the legal parameters governing data use, data science approaches that are technically legal can still be used unethically and irresponsibly, with disastrous consequences from loss of revenue to human rights violations. Through case studies and interactive sessions, this workshop provides an overview of how to practice responsible data science by incorporating considerations of ethics, equity, and justice. We will discuss FACT (fairness, accuracy, confidentiality, and transparency) based approaches to increasing the integrity of our work in data science. By the end of this workshop, learner should be able to: Describe examples of how the development of data science can both contribute to inequities and be leveraged to address them in their own domain. Begin to identify the underlying goals and incentives influencing their data-driven research. Assess whether a research project's data meets FAIR criteria. Use a responsible data science framework to evaluate the potential impact(s) of a research project case study. Revise their research design using FACT principles.",

        "description": "This workshop is an introduction to the Julia programming language for people familiar with R, Python, or MATLAB. Compared to those languages, Julia code typically runs orders of magnitude faster but has a similar level of abstraction, so you can focus on your research problem rather than hardware minutiae. Julia also provides out-of-the-box Unicode support, an easy-to-use package manager, multithreading facilities, a macro system, and a rich type system to optimize and prevent bugs in your code. Workshop topics include a concise overview of Julia's syntax and features, an end-to-end introduction to using built-in functions and contributed packages to read, summarize, and visualize tabular data, and real-world examples where we've found Julia beneficial.

As of November 2023, All of Us boasts over 741,000 enrolled participants, with 508,000 completing initial program steps, over 409,000 electronic medical records, and 525,000 bio samples. Notably, 75% of participants with available data on the All of Us Researcher Workbench identify with underrepresented communities, and 45% belong to racial and ethnic minority groups.\nThe All of Us program provides a user-friendly environment for researchers to use the database through the All of Us Researcher Workbench. This platform offers an accessible and secure space to conduct analyses, ensuring that the wealth of data collected is readily available for scientific exploration. This dataset provides a significant step toward fostering innovation and cultivating a comprehensive understanding of health determinants in diverse populations. By encompassing this broad spectrum of health-related data, the All of Us dataset opens doors for a myriad of analyses, including Exposure Assessment, Health Disparities, Environmental Justice, Genetic-Environmental Interactions, and Behavioral Responses to Environmental Factors.\nSession Content: In the first hour, we will deliver an informative presentation covering the purpose All of Us program, the available participant data and resources, and key benefits for researchers. Additionally, we will showcase various research examples conducted using this extensive database.\nThe second hour, we will focus on guiding participants through enrollment including where to access the database. We will elaborate on the different tools and resources available which provide insights into the workbench. This will include a detailed presentation on creating cohorts and datasets and instructions on exporting data for further analysis.\nThis workshop is particularly relevant for researchers and students engaged in various fields, including public health, epidemiology, medicine, genetics, psychology, and any area where data from Fitbit, medical records, genetics, and social health determinants play a crucial role.",

        "description": "First Session: Sharing and reusing data can effectively reduce redundant efforts in data collection, ultimately saving valuable time and resources, especially for smaller laboratories. Additionally, it enhances the efficiency of scientific research investments by preventing the reinvention of the wheel. Building a sustainable data-reuse process and culture relies on frameworks that comprise policies, standards, roles, and responsibilities, all of which must address the diverse needs of data providers, curators, and (re)users alike. A critical step in the data sharing and (re)use cycle involves researchers identifying data that are (re)usable for their needs. It is a common challenge among researchers to locate data that appear (re)usable. In this session, I aim to introduce 2-3 data repositories ideal for researchers seeking (re)usable data for their studies. Additionally, I will offer several tips and strategies for identifying and utilizing (re)usable data effectively. The session is structured to last approximately 45 minutes, encompassing a 25-minute presentation, a 5-minute question-and-answer segment, and a 10-minute practical workshop exercise. Second Session: Social media is increasingly becoming an important site for data collection and research for students, researchers, and scholars across the Humanities and Social Sciences. This workshop introduces participants to the existing landscape of social media data and the fluctuating access academics have to ‘big datasets'. Using Facebook, Twitter (or X), and Reddit as examples of data archives, we discuss the latest guidelines and restrictions on scraping social media data from these three platforms and how they affect researchers conducting social media research. The workshop urges participants to rethink their notion of “Data” concerning social media to foreground the issue of research ethics that is often sidestepped or not taken seriously due to the presumed publicness of social media data.",

Despite their ubiquity in software development, APIs remain underutilized in humanities research, where they offer immense potential for innovative data collection and analysis.\nIn this session, we'll demystify APIs and showcase their potential through the Library of Congress API. Participants will see step-by-step how to identify if a collection has API access, construct requests, and interpret responses, all with tools like Postman. We'll walk through concepts like authentication, endpoints, parameters, and how to transform JSON responses into tabular data for visualization.\nThis session is designed as a show-and-tell introduction—perfect for researchers and students with no prior coding or data analysis experience. By the end, attendees will have a clear understanding of how APIs work, their practical applications, and how to start integrating them into their research workflows. Get ready to see what APIs can do for your projects!",

Unlike automated tools that rely on blind substitutions, QualiAnon gives you full control over how and when data is anonymized, allowing you to manually define replacement rules for specific datasets or variables. This approach ensures a higher level of accuracy and privacy by stripping identifying information without compromising the richness of the data. In this session, we'll demonstrate how QualiAnon can streamline your data protection efforts, improve your workflow, and ensure compliance with privacy standards.

Quarto enables a more reproducible approach to data-driven research by integrating documentation, code, and results in one document. But it's also a great publication platform on its own! In this session a panel of Quarto users will showcase what Quarto is capable of, especially when used in concert with GitHub Pages hosting, including creating websites (course websites, personal websites, blogs), presentations, dashboards, academic papers, and books. We will also demonstrate, in real-time, how easy it is to create such research deliverables. Prepare to be sold on using Quarto!",

As described by the UC Berkeley Oral History Center, this approach involves producing 'first-person narrative topical and life histories that explore the narrator's understanding of events through a recorded interview...[this] results in a lightly edited transcript of the interview that the narrator reviews, which is then published.' This differs from the more familiar qualitative research interview, in that it is a two-directional, and transparent process... which comes with its own challenges. In this workshop you will learn more about these synergies and contrasts between and within methods, hear more about best practices for conducting oral history projects, and have time to ask questions about project ideas of your own.",

Building a sustainable data-reuse process and culture requires frameworks that include policies, standards, roles, and responsibilities, all of which must address the diverse needs of data providers, curators, and (re)users alike.\nA critical step in the data sharing and (re)use cycle involves researchers depositing their research data into data-sharing infrastructures, keeping their data in a sharable and usable form, making other researchers aware of their data, and identifying data that are (re)usable for their needs.\nIn this session, I aim to introduce some ideas and techniques for preparing research data for sharing. I will also introduce 2 to 3 data repositories ideal for researchers depositing their data and seeking (re)usable data for their studies. Additionally, I will offer several tips and strategies for identifying and utilizing (re)usable data effectively.\nThe session is structured to last approximately 50 minutes, comprising a 40-minute presentation followed by a 10-minute question-and-answer segment.",

At HumTech, our team is engaged in a project to visualize the cataloged manuscripts through Tableau. The goal of this project is to represent a birds eye view of the Islamic manuscript holdings for interested researchers. Through representation of multiple data points that the library cataloging process captured from the manuscripts, the visualization hopes to provide easy access to researchers for dissecting the data in multiple ways and helping them in drawing useful insights into the Islamic manuscript holdings at UCLA. In this presentation, we will be discussing the challenges that we faced in data cleaning, wrangling and visualization that are specific to manuscript collections, especially one that is primarily in non-Latin script and spans to the pre-modern period.",

        "description": "The Industry Documents Library is a digital archive of documents created by industries which influence public health, hosted by the University of California, San Francisco Library. This archive contains millions of video, audio, and image files from the tobacco, opioids, fossil fuel, drug, and food industries, including advertisements, legal depositions, internal marketing documents, public health campaigns, and other historical records. This session will start with a presentation and overview of the contents of the IDL and search interface. Next, we will introduce a python based, open-source stack researchers can use to analyze, transcribe, and categorize data in IDL video, audio, and image files. Although participants will have an opportunity to try out these technologies during the workshop, the primary focus will be an overview of available tools and data, and participation in the programming sections is optional.",
